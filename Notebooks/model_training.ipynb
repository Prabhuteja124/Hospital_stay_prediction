    "### 1. Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "The dataset contained missing values in several columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "- Used **SimpleImputer** with strategy `most_frequent` for categorical variables and `mean` for numerical variables.\n",
    "- Justification: Most frequent imputation helps maintain categorical distributions, while mean imputation works well for numeric skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Imbalanced Target Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "The target variable (`Length of Stay`) was highly imbalanced, with shorter stays being far more frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "- Applied **class weights = 'balanced'** in classifiers like LightGBM and RandomForest.\n",
    "- Also experimented with **SMOTE** for oversampling minority classes during model tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. High Cardinality in Categorical Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "Columns like `Department`,`Type_of_Admission` and `Hospital Code` had a large number of unique categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "- Used **Target Encoding** for high cardinality features.\n",
    "- Used **One-Hot Encoding** for low cardinality features to retain interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.  Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "Some models like KNN and Logistic Regression were sensitive to feature scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "- Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical features.\n",
    "- Tree-based models were excluded from scaling as they are scale-invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.  Model Interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "Need to explain predictions to stakeholders in the healthcare domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "- Selected **LightGBM** for its interpretability.\n",
    "- Used **SHAP values** and **feature importance plots** to highlight contributing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Long Training Times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "Training time was high for ensemble models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "- Reduced feature space using feature importance.\n",
    "- Enabled **multi-threading** with `n_jobs = -1` wherever supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This structured approach helped in building a reliable and interpretable model for predicting patient hospital stay durations. All challenges were addressed with appropriate preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling techniques.\n"
