# Hospital Stay Length Prediction

This project is part of an internship assignment focused on predicting the **length of stay** for patients admitted to hospitals using machine learning techniques. The aim is to support hospitals in planning and managing resources efficiently by predicting how long a patient is likely to stay based on admission details, patient demographics, and clinical factors.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hospital data.
- Train multiple classification models to predict patient length of stay.
- Compare models based on metrics such as Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.
- Tune hyperparameters using Optuna.
- Select and save the best model for deployment.
- Report on challenges and preprocessing techniques used.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

- Patient demographics (e.g., age, gender)
- Admission and discharge types
- Diagnosis and procedures
- Hospital department and insurance type
- Target variable: Length of Stay (multi-class)
